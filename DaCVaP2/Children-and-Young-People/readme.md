## üìù Project description

This study investigates uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine in children and young people (CYP) aged 5-17 between August 2022 and May 2023 in the UK. We used individual level, linked anonymised electronic health and administrative data in England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales to construct cohorts for each nation. We performed bi-directional multi-state models using Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate first, second and booster vaccine uptake while accounting for the competing risk of infection on each national cohort. The resulting adjusted log hazard ratios and corresponding standard errors were combined in a two-stage random effects meta-analysis to represent vaccine uptake across the whole of the UK. We included age, sex, the size of the CYP household, and the vaccination status of other members of the CYP household. Rurality, Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) and ethnicity is included in the supplentary, but was not available in all nations.
