# 0. Message to reviewers

This document summarises the results of a multi-state model performed on children and young people aged 5-17.
The files generated contain a mixture of summary plots (this document) and statistical data (accompanying csv documents).
No small numbers are present and so no censoring has been performed.

# 1. Research aim

Analyse uptake of first, second and third/booster doses of COVID-19 vaccines in children and young people aged 5-17 in England.


# 2. Approach


## Study design

 - Statistical analysis of e-cohort of children and young people ages 5-17 alive and living in England from 4th August 2021 to 31st May 2022. Including a multi-state model and survival analysis.



# 3. Analysis

- Multistate model performed to investigate vaccine uptake for each dose of vaccine across 4 variables:
 * Age
 * Sex
 * Household vaccination status
 * Number of people in household


## Fig 3.1 The multistate model

# 4. Results

```{r}
kv <- readRDS("results/key_values.rds")
```

A total of `r kv$n[3]` children and young people were included in the study. Of these individuals, `r kv$n[4]` received their first vaccine, `r kv$n[5]` had their second, and `r kv$n[6]` their third/booster dose. A total of `r kv$n[8]` CYP became infected during the study, and `r kv$n[7]` died.

## Table 4.1 Cohort summary

```{r}
t_sum <- readRDS("results/t_sum.rds") %>% rename(Variable = type) %>%
  kable(
    format.args = list(big.mark = ",")
    ) %>%
  kable_styling(
    bootstrap_options = "striped",
    full_width = FALSE
    )

d_sum <- readRDS("results/d_sum.rds") %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = status, values_from = n) %>%
  kable(
    format.args = list(big.mark = ",")
    ) %>%
  kable_styling(
    bootstrap_options = "striped",
    full_width = FALSE
    )

```

## Table 4.3: Events summary

Of the `r kv$n[3]` CYP included, `r kv$n[2]` began entered the study uninfected and eligible for a vaccine. `r kv$n[1]` CYP began the study within 28 days of infection, and so entered the model in the "infected" state.

```{r}
t_events <- readRDS("results/t_events.rds") %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = to, values_from = Freq) %>%
  mutate(
    unvacc = case_when(between(unvacc,1,9) ~ "<10", TRUE ~ as.character(unvacc)),
    infection = case_when(between(infection,1,9) ~ "<10", TRUE ~ as.character(infection)),
    dose_1 = case_when(between(dose_1,1,9) ~ "<10", TRUE ~ as.character(dose_1)),
    dose_2 = case_when(between(dose_2,1,9) ~ "<10", TRUE ~ as.character(dose_2)),
    dose_3 = case_when(between(dose_3,1,9) ~ "<10", TRUE ~ as.character(dose_3)),
    death = case_when(between(death,1,9) ~ "<10", TRUE ~ as.character(death)),
    `no event` = case_when(between(`no event`,1,9) ~ "<10", TRUE ~ as.character(`no event`)),
    `total entering` = case_when(between(`total entering`,1,9) ~ "<10", TRUE ~ as.character(`total entering`))
    ) %>%
  rename(unvaccinated = unvacc, "dose 1" = dose_1, "dose 2" = dose_2, "dose 3" = dose_3)
t_events %>% kable(
    format.args = list(big.mark = ",")
) %>%
kable_styling(
    bootstrap_options = "striped",
    full_width = FALSE
)
```

## Table 4.4: Multistate model output

This table below displays the results for transitions 2,9 and 12 representing the transitions from eligible to the following dose.

```{r}

kable(
    format.args = list(big.mark = ",")
) %>%
