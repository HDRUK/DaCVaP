# National Core Study – Data and Connectivity: COVID-19 Vaccines Pharmacovigilance (DaC-VaP) & (DaC-VaP-2)


## Project description

DaC-VaP (January – October 2021) was a UK-wide collaboration that investigated the safety and effectiveness of the first COVID-19 vaccines in England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. https://www.ed.ac.uk/usher/eave-ii/connected-projects/dac-vap

Building upon this work, the DaC-VaP-2 project (November 2021 – January 2023) then examined the uptake, safety and effectiveness of these vaccines in pregnant women, in children and young people, when given as a booster dose and against disease caused by different variants. These topics were selected after engaging with a range of patient, public, community, professional and health policy groups who identified these as the highest priority research questions.
