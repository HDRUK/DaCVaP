## Data availability statement 

The Statistical Analysis plan of this work is available at [SAP](https://github.com/HDRUK/DaCVaP/blob/main/Wales/SAP/Workplan%20-%20Vaccine%20Safety.pdf). 
We also made the code and data to reproduce figures available through this repository. 
Information and meta-data of the main patient-level data sources used in this study are available openly at [HDRUK Innovation gateway](https://www.healthdatagateway.org/); 
however the patient level data sources is only available through the secure analyticail platform of the SAIL Databank at Swansea University, Swansea, UK. 
All proposals to use SAIL data are subject to review by an independent Information Governance Review Panel (IGRP). Before any data can be accessed, approval must be given by the IGRP. The IGRP gives careful consideration to each project to ensure proper and appropriate use of SAIL data. When access has been granted, it is gained through a privacy protecting safe haven and remote access system referred to as the SAIL Gateway. SAIL has established an application process to be followed by anyone who would like to access data via [SAIL applications](https://www.saildatabank.com/application-process/).
